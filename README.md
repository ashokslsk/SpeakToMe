# SpeakToMe

Integrating intent based _speech recognizer_ to your android app

## Resources

* [Java Class used](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognizerIntent.html) - Helpful website for extracting more information.

* Write a method **promptSpeechInput()** which instantiates google speech dialog like how it is shown below.

```

private void promptSpeechInput() {
		Intent intent = new Intent(RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH);
		intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL,
				RecognizerIntent.LANGUAGE_MODEL_FREE_FORM);
		intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_LANGUAGE, Locale.getDefault());
		intent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PROMPT,
				getString(R.string.speech_prompt));
		try {
			startActivityForResult(intent, REQ_CODE_SPEECH_INPUT);
		} catch (ActivityNotFoundException a) {
			Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),
					getString(R.string.speech_not_supported),
					Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
		}
	}
```	
* After all call **onActivityResult(params...)** to check the processed information.

```

/**
	 * Receiving speech input
	 * */
	@Override
	protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
		super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

		switch (requestCode) {
		case REQ_CODE_SPEECH_INPUT: {
			if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && null != data) {

				ArrayList<String> result = data
						.getStringArrayListExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_RESULTS);
				txtSpeechInput.setText(result.get(0));
			}
			break;
		}

		}
	}
```
